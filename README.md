# Chapter 3 of Programming Collective Intelligence : Discovering Groups

## Main
* Worked through Clusters of Preferences subsection

## TODO

## Exercises
- [ ] Now compare 2 of the subreddits
- [ ] Now compare them all
## Notes (Think of a way to use the reddit API for analysis)
(tried top submissions on a subreddit, users for keys and submission text for word collections)
- [ ] Use reddit API to gather posts in about 10 subreddits
- [ ] Using just one subreddit create a cluster and dendrogram
